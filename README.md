# 👋 Hi there, I'm Matthew Ryan!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate and curious student starting my journey in **Mathematics with Data Science** at **LSE** (London School of Economics). I'm deeply interested in **data science**, **machine learning**, and the broader field of **artificial intelligence**, and I'm excited to explore how mathematical thinking can drive innovation in these areas.

## 🔬 Current Focus
- 📚 Studying **Mathematics with Data Science** at LSE
- 🧠 Learning core concepts in **machine learning**, **AI**, and **statistical modeling**
- 💻 Practicing Python, R, and exploring tools like, pandas, plotly and scikit-learn
- 📈 Exploring the intersection of **finance** and **data science**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- Programming: `Python`, `R`, `SQL`
- Data Science: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `Plotly`
- AI/ML (early stages): `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`, `Keras` (exploring)
- Workflow: `Jupyter`, `Git`, `VS Code`

---

## 📊 Interests
- 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** – understanding how models learn and can be implemented into different sectors.
- 🧮 **Mathematics** – particularly in optimization, statistics, and probability.
- 🏋️ **Fitness** – exploring how AI can optimise health and fitness.
